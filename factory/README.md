# Factory Example

This example presents a factory of [donation contracts](https://github.com/near-examples/donation-rust). It allows to:
1. Create a sub-account of the factory and deploy the stored contract on it (`create_factory_subaccount_and_deploy`).
2. Change the stored contract using the `update_stored_contract` method.
